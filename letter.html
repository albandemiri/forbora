            To the person that took my heart and made it better
        </p>
        <p>My darling, since I've met you I've been in loss of words. Even though my soul is filled with countless emotions and my brain with many fancy words, my tounge was bitten and my hand was numb. Many letters sit unfinished inside my drawers and on my notebooks. A lot of words unsaid.</p>
        <p>Since last summer, I have changed a lot. Since I met you, a light was lit in my soul. A light of hope, of love, of meaning, of a life worth to be lived. Knowing you I discovered God's miracles, which for a time I had lost faith in their existence. When you let me in you heart I felt so little. I still feel little, at times undeserving of your love.</p>
        <p>I want to say sorry for every time I hurt you, for every time you felt bad and uneasy, for every time you shed a tear because of me, for every time you denied yourself for the sake of our love. Unfortunately you didn't meet me at my very best</p>
